Dear Alex,
Thank your for inviting me to your party this Saturday afternoon. But I'm so sorry for not being able to go to the pary because I have to go out of this city for competition. It's important for me.
I will be free next Saturday so we can celebrate a party together at a restaurant.
See you soon,
Vinh.
