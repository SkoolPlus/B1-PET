# An email: A homework project

```
You need some help with a poster you have to design for a homework project.
Write an email to your English friend, Jan. In your email:
- say what your poster is about
- explain how Jan can help you
- suggest when you can meet.
Write your email in about 100 words.
```

```
Dear Jan,
I want to ask for your help. I have to design a poster that is about protecting the environment. I don't have any ideas about it. I hope you can help me because I hear that you have a lot of experience and you are a good student.
I need to finish my work before next Friday. Can we meet on Sunday evening?
See you soon,
Nam.
