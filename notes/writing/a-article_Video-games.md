VIDEO GAMES

There are many kinds of video games. My favourite kind of games is MOBA such as League of Legends, Dota. I often play video games with my friend after school. I feel relaxed and connect with my friends in game.
Some games are designed to teach players something useful. In recent years, video games help people improve their skill and knowledge. For example, pilots play Microsoft Flight Simulator to learn how to fly planes.
However, if young people spend too much time on playing video games, they will be tired and can't finish their work.
In conclusion, video games are both entertaining and educational. I think it will be good if you don't play video game too much.
